### Phase 1: Context Gathering

```markdown
Before reviewing code:

1. Read the PR/MR description
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What approach was taken?
   - Are there known limitations?

2. Check related documents
   - Specification (docs/specs/)
   - Implementation plan (docs/planning/)
   - Related ADRs (docs/adr/)

3. Check regression guards
   - Are any guarded files modified?
   - What invariants must be maintained?
   - What regression tests should pass?

4. Understand the scope
   - How many files changed?
   - What's the risk level?
   - Is this a refactor or new feature?
```

### Phase 2: Code Review

#### Review Order

```markdown
1. Architecture (big picture)
   - Does the design fit the system?
   - Are responsibilities correctly placed?
   - Any circular dependencies?

2. Logic (correctness)
   - Does the code do what it's supposed to?
   - Are edge cases handled?
   - Is error handling appropriate?

3. Standards (compliance)
   - .ace/standards/coding.md
   - .ace/standards/security.md
   - .ace/standards/architecture.md

4. Tests (coverage)
   - Are tests adequate?
   - Do tests cover edge cases?
   - Are tests maintainable?

5. Documentation (clarity)
   - Is complex logic explained?
   - Are public APIs documented?
   - Is the PR description complete?

6. Guards (regression prevention)
   - Are invariants maintained?
   - Do regression tests pass?
   - Any new guards needed?
```

### Phase 3: Feedback

#### Comment Types

| Type | Prefix | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Blocking | `[BLOCKING]` | Must fix before merge |
| Suggestion | `[SUGGESTION]` | Consider this improvement |
| Question | `[QUESTION]` | Need clarification |
| Nitpick | `[NIT]` | Minor style preference |
| Praise | `[PRAISE]` | Good work, worth noting |

#### Feedback Guidelines

```markdown
DO:
- Be specific about what and why
- Suggest alternatives, not just problems
- Reference standards when applicable
- Acknowledge good work
- Ask questions to understand intent

DON'T:
- Be vague ("this is wrong")
- Attack the person ("you always...")
- Bikeshed minor style issues
- Block on personal preferences
- Leave comments without context
```

### Phase 4: Verification

```markdown
After author addresses feedback:

1. Verify blocking issues resolved
2. Run tests locally if significant changes
3. Check regression tests pass
4. Confirm guard compliance
5. Approve or request more changes
```

## Time Guidelines

| PR Size | Review Time |
|---------|-------------|
| XS (< 50 lines) | 15-30 min |
| S (50-200 lines) | 30-60 min |
| M (200-500 lines) | 1-2 hours |

## Common Issues to Watch

1. **Silent failures** - Catching and ignoring errors
2. **Missing validation** - Trusting external input
3. **Race conditions** - Concurrent access issues
4. **Resource leaks** - Unclosed connections/handles
5. **Hardcoded values** - Config that should be external
6. **Breaking changes** - API changes without versioning
7. **Missing tests** - New code without coverage
8. **Guard violations** - Changes that break invariants

---

## Invocation

```markdown
"Apply the code review skill from .ace/skills/code-review.md
for this PR/code change. Follow the review checklist and provide
structured feedback. Check regression guards for modified files."
```
