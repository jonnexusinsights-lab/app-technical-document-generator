## 1. Introduction

### What is ACE-Framework?

ACE-Framework (AI-assisted Code Engineering) is a structured methodology for working with AI coding assistants. It ensures:

- **Consistency** - Same patterns across sessions and team members
- **Context Preservation** - No lost work between sessions
- **Quality** - Standards enforced at every step
- **Safety** - Regression prevention through guards

### The BMAD Methodology

Every task follows four phases:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                          BMAD Cycle                                   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                       │
│   ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌──────┐         │

│       └──────────────◀────────────────────────────────────┘           │
│                    (Feedback Loop)                                    │
│                           │                                           │
│                    ┌──────┴──────┐                                    │
│                    │  INCIDENT   │ (When issues found)                │
│                    └─────────────┘                                    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Never skip steps.** This prevents costly mistakes and rework.

## 2. Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

If you're setting up a new project with ACE-Framework:

1. **Copy the framework structure** to your project
2. **Customize standards** for your tech stack
3. **Create initial ADRs** for existing decisions
4. **Set up IDE configuration** (`.cursorrules`, `.vscode/`)

### Starting Your First Session

When you begin working with an AI assistant:

```markdown
"I am starting a new session with the ACE-Framework. Please:

1. Read .aceconfig for project rules
2. Read .ace/roles/roles.md for available roles
3. Read docs/context/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md for current state
4. Read docs/rca/regression-guards.yaml for protected files

Confirm you understand the context, then await instructions."
```

**What the AI will do:**

- Load project configuration
- Understand available roles
- See where previous work left off
- Know which files need special care

### Understanding Your Current State

Before starting work, check:

```markdown
"What is the current state of the project?
Summarize ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md and any pending tasks."
```

---

## 3. Daily Workflows

### Workflow A: Starting a New Feature

**Step 1: Analyze & Discuss**

```markdown
"Set mode to ANALYZE with Architect role.
I need to implement [feature description].
Analyze requirements, then run the Discuss phase to align on preferences."
```

**Step 2: Plan**

```markdown
"Use the preferences in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to create an implementation plan.
Output tasks using the new XML format."
```

**Step 2: Review the Plan**
The AI will create `docs/planning/implementation_plan.md`. Review it:

- Are tasks correctly broken down?
- Are dependencies in order?
- Are acceptance criteria clear?

**Step 3: Approve and Execute**

```markdown
"The plan is approved. Switch to Developer role and EXECUTION mode.
Commit effectively: One atomic commit per task. No batching."
```

**Step 4: Verify**

```markdown
"Switch to QA Engineer role and VERIFICATION mode.
Verify the implementation against the acceptance criteria."
```

### Workflow B: Fixing a Bug

**Step 1: Investigate**

```markdown
"I found a bug: [description].
Investigate the issue and identify potential causes."
```

**Step 2: If Simple Fix**

```markdown
"This is a simple fix. Implement the fix following coding standards.
Write a test that would have caught this bug."
```

**Step 3: If Complex or Recurring**

```markdown
"This needs root cause analysis.
Switch to INCIDENT mode and apply the RCA skill."
```

### Workflow C: Continuing Previous Work

**Step 1: Load Context**

```markdown
"Read ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md and continue from where we left off.
What are the next steps?"
```

**Step 2: Resume Work**

```markdown
"Continue with [next task from context].
Remember to check regression guards for any files we modify."
```

### Workflow D: Code Review

```markdown
"Apply the code-review skill to review this PR/code change.
Check for standards compliance, security issues, and regression guards."
```

---

## 4. Working with Roles

### Available Roles

| Role                   | When to Use                             | Key Focus                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Architect**          | Planning new features, design decisions | Big picture, patterns, ADRs  |
| **Developer**          | Writing code, implementing features     | Clean code, tests, standards |
| **QA Engineer**        | Testing, verification                   | Edge cases, regression       |
| **Incident Responder** | Fixing bugs, investigating issues       | RCA, prevention              |
| **Data Scientist**     | Analysis, experiments                   | Statistics, rigor            |
| **AI Expert**          | Algorithm design, model work            | Theory, optimization         |
| **Scientific Editor**  | Writing papers, documentation           | Clarity, precision           |

### Activating a Role

```markdown
"Switch to [Role Name] role."
```

Or more explicitly:

```markdown
"Assume the Developer role defined in .ace/roles/roles.md.
Focus on clean implementation following the approved plan."
```

### Role Transitions

Roles follow a natural flow:

```
Feature Development:
Architect → Developer → QA Engineer

Bug Investigation:
Any Role → Incident Responder → Previous Role

Research:
AI Expert → Data Scientist → Scientific Editor
```

**Important:** Complete one role's work before switching. Update `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` at transitions.

## 5. Using Skills

### What Are Skills?

Skills are detailed procedures for specific tasks. They contain:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Checklists
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Validation criteria

### Available Skills

| Skill                    | Use For                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `api-design.md`          | Creating REST APIs       |
| `database-operations.md` | Schema changes, queries  |
| `migration-logic.md`     | Data/schema migrations   |
| `refactoring.md`         | Improving code structure |
| `root-cause-analysis.md` | Investigating issues     |
| `testing-strategy.md`    | Writing tests            |
| `code-review.md`         | Reviewing code           |

### Invoking a Skill

```markdown
"Apply the [skill-name] skill from .ace/skills/[skill-name].md
for this task. Follow the procedure and checklist."
```

**Example:**

```markdown
"Apply the database-operations skill for this schema migration.
Follow the pre-migration checklist and create a rollback plan."
```

### Skill Automatic Triggers

Some keywords automatically suggest skills:

- "database", "migration", "schema" → `database-operations.md`
- "api", "endpoint", "REST" → `api-design.md`
- "test", "coverage" → `testing-strategy.md`
- "bug", "issue", "incident" → `root-cause-analysis.md`
- "refactor", "clean up" → `refactoring.md`

---

## 6. Managing Context

### The ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md File

This file is the "memory" between sessions. It contains:

- Current objective
- What's working/broken/blocked
- Next steps
- Active constraints

### Updating Context

**During work:**

```markdown
"Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md: Task 2 is complete, moving to Task 3."
```

**End of session:**

```markdown
"Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md with:

- Completed: [what was done]
- Next steps: [what to do next]
- Notes: [anything important to remember]"
```

### Reading Context

**At session start:**

```markdown
"Read ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md and summarize the current state."
```

**To check status:**

```markdown
"What is my current objective according to ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md?"
```

### Context Best Practices

1. **Update frequently** - Don't wait until session end
2. **Be specific** - "Implemented user validation" not "worked on user stuff"
3. **Include blockers** - If something is stuck, document why
4. **List next steps** - Future you will thank present you

---

## 7. Handling Issues

### When You Find a Bug

**Step 1: Document It**

```markdown
"I found an issue: [description]
Document the symptoms and how to reproduce."
```

**Step 2: Assess Severity**

| Severity | Criteria               | Response        |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Critical | System down, data loss | Immediate fix   |
| High     | Major feature broken   | Fix today       |
| Medium   | Feature degraded       | Fix this sprint |
| Low      | Minor issue            | Backlog         |

**Step 3: For Medium+ Issues, Create RCA**

```markdown
"Switch to INCIDENT mode.
Apply root-cause-analysis skill to investigate this issue."
```

### The RCA Process

1. **Document** - Capture symptoms, evidence
2. **Analyze** - Use 5 Whys to find root cause
3. **Fix** - Immediate fix + permanent fix
4. **Prevent** - Add tests, guards, update standards
5. **Verify** - Confirm fix and prevention work

### Creating a Regression Guard

After fixing an issue:

```markdown
"Create a regression guard for this fix.
Add to docs/rca/regression-guards.yaml with:

- Guarded files
- Invariants that must be maintained
- Tests that verify the fix"
```

### Checking Guards Before Modifying Files

**Always before editing:**

```markdown
"Check if [filename] has a regression guard.
If so, what invariants must be maintained?"
```

---

## 8. Code Review Process

### Requesting a Review

```markdown
"Apply the code-review skill to review this code.
Check against:

- .ace/standards/coding.md
- .ace/standards/security.md
- Regression guards for modified files"
```

### Review Checklist

The AI will check:

- [ ] Code standards compliance
- [ ] Security requirements
- [ ] Architecture patterns
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Regression guard compliance
- [ ] Documentation

### Responding to Feedback

Feedback comes in types:

- **[BLOCKING]** - Must fix before merge
- **[SUGGESTION]** - Consider improving
- **[QUESTION]** - Needs clarification
- **[NIT]** - Minor style preference

---

## 9. Common Scenarios

### Scenario: "I don't know where to start"

```markdown
"I need to [goal]. I'm not sure where to begin.
Read the codebase and suggest an approach."
```

### Scenario: "The previous developer left no documentation"

```markdown
"Read the code in [directory] and create documentation:

1. What does this code do?
2. How does it fit into the system?
3. What are the key functions/classes?"
```

### Scenario: "I need to understand an existing decision"

```markdown
"Read all ADRs in docs/adr/ and explain why we use [technology/pattern]."
```

### Scenario: "Something broke after a change"

```markdown
"Something broke after my changes to [file].
Check regression guards and identify what invariant I may have violated."
```

### Scenario: "I need to add a feature like an existing one"

```markdown
"I need to add [new feature] similar to [existing feature].
Show me the existing implementation and create a plan for the new one."
```

### Scenario: "The AI is suggesting something that conflicts with our patterns"

```markdown
"Check docs/adr/ and docs/context/system_patterns.md.
Does your suggestion align with our established patterns?"
```

### Scenario: "I need to make an architectural decision"

```markdown
"Switch to Architect role.
I need to decide between [option A] and [option B].
Analyze trade-offs and create an ADR with the recommendation."
```

### Scenario: "I need to hand off work to a colleague"

```markdown
"Update ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md with a complete handoff summary:

- What was accomplished
- Current state of each component
- Pending decisions
- Known issues
- Recommended next steps"
```

---

## 10. Best Practices

### Do's

✅ **Start every session by reading context**

```markdown
"Read .aceconfig and ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md before we begin."
```

✅ **Use roles appropriately**

- Architect for planning
- Developer for coding
- QA for verification

✅ **Check guards before modifying files**

```markdown
"Check regression guards for files I'm about to modify."
```

✅ **Update context frequently**

- After completing tasks
- When encountering blockers
- At end of session

✅ **Create ADRs for decisions**

```markdown
"Create an ADR for the decision to use [technology/pattern]."
```

✅ **Follow BMAD**

- Analyze → Plan → Execute → Verify
- Never skip phases

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't skip planning**

- "Just write the code" leads to rework

❌ **Don't ignore standards**

- Standards exist for good reasons

❌ **Don't modify guarded files without checking**

- Guards prevent regressions

❌ **Don't forget to update context**

- Future sessions depend on it

❌ **Don't mix roles**

- Complete one role's work before switching

❌ **Don't skip verification**

- Testing catches issues early

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Problem: AI doesn't follow project patterns

**Solution:**

```markdown
"Read docs/context/system_patterns.md and docs/adr/.
Follow the established patterns in this codebase."
```

### Problem: AI suggests conflicting approach

**Solution:**

```markdown
"Check if there's an ADR that addresses this.
If our approach differs, explain why based on project constraints."
```

### Problem: Lost context between sessions

**Solution:**

```markdown
"Read ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md and all files in docs/planning/.
Reconstruct what was happening and continue."
```

If ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md is outdated:

```markdown
"The context seems outdated. Read recent git commits and
reconstruct the current project state."
```

### Problem: AI generates code that violates standards

**Solution:**

```markdown
"Verify this code against .ace/standards/coding.md and
.ace/standards/security.md. Fix any violations."
```

### Problem: Regression after changes

**Solution:**

```markdown
"Check docs/rca/regression-guards.yaml for the affected file.
What invariant was violated? How do we fix it?"
```

### Problem: Unclear requirements

**Solution:**

```markdown
"The requirements are unclear. Before proceeding:

1. List what I understand
2. List what needs clarification
3. Suggest reasonable assumptions"
```

### Problem: Don't know which skill to use

**Solution:**

```markdown
"I need to [task description].
Which skill in .ace/skills/ would help with this?"
```
