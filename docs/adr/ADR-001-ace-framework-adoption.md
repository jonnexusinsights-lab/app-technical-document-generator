# ADR-001: ACE-Framework Adoption

> **Status:** Accepted
> **Date:** 2024-01-28

---

## Context

The project requires a structured approach to AI-assisted development to ensure:
- Consistency across different AI agents and sessions
- Prevention of context drift between sessions
- Enforcement of coding and security standards
- Documentation of architectural decisions
- Clear workflow for AI-human collaboration

Without a structured framework, AI-assisted development tends to produce inconsistent results, lose context between sessions, and make decisions that conflict with existing patterns.

---

## Decision

We will adopt the ACE-Framework (AI-assisted Code Engineering) v2.0 as the standard for all AI-assisted development in this project.

This includes:
- Using the `.ace/` directory structure for AI context
- Following BMAD methodology (Analyze → Plan → Execute → Verify)
- Maintaining `docs/context/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` for session state
- Recording all significant decisions as ADRs in `docs/adr/`
- Defining agent roles in `.ace/roles/roles.md`
- Using skills in `.ace/skills/` for specialized tasks

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Framework
Using AI assistants ad-hoc without structured methodology.
- **Pros:** Less overhead, faster initial setup
- **Cons:** Inconsistent results, context loss, conflicting patterns
- **Why Rejected:** Leads to technical debt and maintenance issues

### Alternative 2: Custom Minimal Framework
Creating a lighter-weight custom approach.
- **Pros:** Simpler, fewer files
- **Cons:** Missing important components, would evolve to ACE anyway
- **Why Rejected:** ACE-Framework already solves the problems comprehensively

### Alternative 3: IDE-Specific Solutions
Using built-in AI features of specific IDEs only.
- **Pros:** Tighter integration, simpler setup
- **Cons:** Vendor lock-in, inconsistent across team members
- **Why Rejected:** Team uses multiple IDEs and AI tools

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent AI-assisted development across the team
- Context preserved between sessions via ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
- Architectural decisions documented and searchable
- Clear workflow prevents AI from skipping important steps
- Standards automatically referenced during development

### Negative
- Initial learning curve for team members
- Overhead of maintaining context documents
- More files to manage in the repository

### Neutral
- Requires discipline to follow the process
- ADR count will grow over time

---

## Compliance

Compliance will be verified through:
- Code reviews checking for ADR references on significant decisions
- Pre-commit hooks validating file structure
- Session start prompts that reference ACE-Framework
- Periodic audits of ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md currency
