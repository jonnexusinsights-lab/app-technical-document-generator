# Regression Guards Registry
#
# This file tracks all known issues and their prevention mechanisms.
# AI agents MUST check this file before modifying guarded files.
# CI/CD should validate changes against these guards.
#
# Status: Active
# Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

version: "1.0"

# How to use:
# 1. After each RCA, add a guard entry here
# 2. Before modifying any file, check if it's guarded
# 3. If guarded, review the RCA and ensure fix is not regressed
# 4. Run associated tests before committing
